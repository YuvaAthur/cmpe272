Ref: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/115838/what-is-the-right-file-permission-for-a-pem-file-to-ssh-and-scp 

1) Download the .pem file.
2) In Amazon Dashboard choose "Instances" from the left side bar, and then select the instance you would like to connect to.
3) Click on "Actions", then select "Connect"
4) Click on "Connect with a Standalone SSH Client"
5) Open up a Terminal window
# mkdir -p ~/.ssh
# mv ~/Downloads/ec2private.pem ~/.ssh
# chmod 400 ~/.ssh/ec2private.pem
# vim ~/.ssh/config
Enter the following text into that config file:

    Host *amazonaws.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ec2private.pem
    User ec2-user
    
Save that file.

6) Use the ssh command with your public DNS hostname to connect to your instance.
e.g.:
# ssh ec2-54-23-23-23-34.example.amazonaws.com
